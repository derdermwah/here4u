    <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
    <div class="content" id="whoAreWe">
    <p>We are <b>"here4u."</b>, a group of young people united by a shared purpose came together to address a pressing issue: <b>the mental health challenges faced by youth, especially those in the LGBTQ+ community</b>. The group consists of a wide array of many different people, including students, social workers, activists, artists, and more, all committed to the same cause.<br><br>Having conceptualized the group in high school, the founding members of "here4u." reconnected years later in hopes of revitalizing their idea from when they were young. Slowly but steadily, the group has since grown a lot from that small group of friends it started out as, becoming a full advocacy group with campaigns, projects, and even collaborating with other well-known advocacy groups.</p>
    <img alt="The founder of the group!" src="info pic.jpg" id="pfp">
    <p id="founderInfo">My name is <b>Xander Miguel C. Magayo (he/they)</b> and I'm the current lead of here4u. I chose youth and LGBTQ+ youth mental health as an advocacy because, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and a strong advocate of mental health, these causes are very close to my heart. I think that our mental health is just as, if not the most, important aspect of ourselves that we should take care of. With here4u., I hope to help other youths struggling with their mental health, especially those in the LGBTQ+ community because they are very vulnerable to developing mental health issues.</p>
