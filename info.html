            <article>
                <p>We are <strong>"here4u."</strong>, a group of young people united by a shared purpose came together to address a pressing issue: <strong>the mental health challenges faced by youth, especially those in the LGBTQ+ community</strong>. The group consists of a wide array of many different people, including students, social workers, activists, artists, and more, all committed to the same cause.</p>
                <img alt="The founder of the group!" src="info pic.jpg" id="pfp">
                <p id="founderInfo">My name is <strong>Xander Miguel C. Magayo (he/they)</strong> and I'm the current lead of here4u. I chose youth and LGBTQ+ youth mental health as an advocacy because, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and a strong advocate of mental health, these causes are very close to my heart. I think that our mental health is just as, if not the most, important aspect of ourselves that we should take care of. With here4u., I hope to help other youths struggling with their mental health, especially those in the LGBTQ+ community because they are very vulnerable to developing mental health issues.</p>
